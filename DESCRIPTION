Description: Support for measurement units in R vectors, matrices
    and arrays: automatic propagation, conversion, derivation
    and simplification of units; raising errors in case of unit
    incompatibility. Compatible with the POSIXct, Date and difftime 
    classes. Uses the UNIDATA udunits library and unit database for 
    unit compatibility checking and conversion.
