Description: Support for measurement units in R vectors, matrices
	and arrays: automatic propagation, conversion, derivation
	and simplification of units; raising errors in case of unit
	incompatibility. Compatible with the POSIXct, Date and difftime 
	classes. Uses the UNIDATA udunits library and unit database for 
	unit compatibility checking and conversion.
