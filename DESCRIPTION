Description: Support for measurement units in R vectors, matrices
	and arrays: automatic propagation, conversion, derivation
	and simplification of units; raising errors in case of unit
	incompatibility. Compatible with the POSIXct, Date and difftime 
	classes. Uses the UNIDATA udunits library and unit database for 
	unit compatibility checking and conversion.
	Documentation about 'units' is provided in the paper by Pebesma, Mailund &
  Hiebert (2016, <doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-061>), included in this package as a
  vignette; see 'citation("units")' for details.
