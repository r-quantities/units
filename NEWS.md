* deal with trigonometric functions for units degree; return units rad on inverse trigonometric functions.

* Unit creation has been significantly refactored. `units<-` now accepts strings
or quoted language objects on the right hand side, powered by new S3 methods for
`as_units`. All valid unit symbols and unit names recognized by package 'udunits2' are 
now accepted. New user facing function `make_units()` (plural s) is also
provided. See `?as_units` for details. @t-kalinowski

* new functions `valid_udunits()` and `valid_udunits_prefixes()` generate tidy
dataframes listing all the valid unit names, symbols, and prefixes recognized by
udunits. @t-kalinowski

* new function `install_symbolic_unit()` for adding custom, user-defined units. 
@t-kalinowski

* `make_unit` and `parse_unit` (singular unit) have been deprecated, please use 
`as_units` instead.

* `ud_units` is no longer necessary and is soft-deprecated, and may be removed
in a future release.

# version 0.4-6

* add `all.equal` method for `units`; #51

* add `deparse_unit` to replace `as_cf`

* add calender/time conversions between `udunits` time units like `minutes from 1900-0-0`, and R's `POSIXct` and `Date`

* add `as_units` to replace `as.units`

* rename `as.dt` to `as_difftime`

# version 0.4-5

* properly set log units after log transform; #33

* `sin`, `cos` and `tan` no longer complain when units is `rad`, and return `unitless`; #40 

* now allow for `set_units(1:3, "Â°C")` and also `set_units(1:3, "degree_Celsius")` by resolving names to symbols first; #43

* `set_units(x)` with `x` numeric sets units to `unitless`; #41

# version 0.4-4

* fix a result units bug when multiplying or dividing units vectors of different length, #34

* add a `rep` method for `units` vectors

# version 0.4-3

* support for `set_units(1:10, m)` which does not require to declare or define, `m` (`m` is resolved automatically from `ud_units`)
